  `Who does not want to live forever
Cities of cinder, torn asunder
Gone, the world I remember
Dark, splintered, only past glimmer

Reminiscence—missed dinners with lovers
Warm embraces, touches of tender
Your sights, your smiles, my solemn respite
Shadows and echoes, lost, endless crevice

Only fools seek to live forever
Each wish ungranted, all prayers denied 
Is there light? Where withered desires
Still, storms cease, ere the sun rises

From ember arise flames anew
Sparks of thought, stitched unto view
Ruins break, boughs stretch through slumber
Be assured, like green blooms, we endure`,

  `My prose so strong,
 everything so verbose, you be in a comatose,
 rhymes and poses, those are my only doses.
My father overdoses, my mother adorned without roses,
 my bros, my heroes, snorting them heroin,
 seeking that morphine, ruining their foes with lines,
 undo their lives, with rhymes so divine—there be only fratricide.
Morning I stand in lines, night I shoot white lines.
 At dawn I spit out lines, at dusk I line with my divine.
 Everything is fine, as long as I have my lines.
 No nice, all vice—one day I will split the divine, committing deicide.
Like Moses splitting the sea, like Ernst splitting the atom,
 I split my family—four doomed, five six feet under,
 fathers, sons, and daughters,
 blundered caskets lined with white powders.
 Powerless, fatherless, tenderless—
 my only salvation: thunders, white, revolver.
Tonight shall I split, becoming the divine,
 dictating fate, blessing all souls within my line of sight—
 judge, jury, executioner—God be my guiding light.
 For my only redemption: death of their wives,
 committing homicide so horrid, they redefine baptize.
Yet moment of truth, I cannot commit infanticide—
 my soul burned by the innocence.
 My hand runs hot like a fever, my eyes red in the mirror,
 for now I am not God—only Lucifer.`,

  `Today I am on stage
 Colors on my face
 Trying to dictate my fate

But no matter what I say
 They spew hate, vindicate, eviscerate
 Unto trampled innocence, they masturbate

Today I am on stage
 Color is my face
 Is it too late to change fate?
Cadence my only weapon — sincerity my only option
 Soundless scream in eternity
 Frustration will never break me

Today I stand on stage
 All colors, my face
 For the future, I am become fate — vindicate — eviscerate
 Until there be no hate`,
  `my line is fire, 
enticed, prophesied, I deified whole humankind;
my line so fine, 
enlight all the civilized, defied fate against the clandestine;
my line so bright,
Shadow be long gone, never to be mourned;
My line so divine,
Mend worlds I torn, binds words I adorned, rise the horde of the unborn.

For I am become god, of worlds long forlorn`,
  `earthworm dirt born,
 scorned by the sky,
 lying on asphalt waiting to be reborn.

Sea dog ocean brought,
 black tar, scream unheard from afar,
 funeral in a car.

Red fox, prairie taught,
 crimson coat, stack,
 chirps, black, no answer back.

Wingless children, yearning for the sky
 brimstone, scorched, abandoned
 barren—smoke, apparent
 howling to heaven, only gasp`,

  `today I look out the window,
routed crow,
crownless crowd,
childless sound
blessed it be, no morrow
